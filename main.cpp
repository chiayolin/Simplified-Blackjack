The cards 2-10 are worth their own numbers while \'J\', \'Q\' and \'K\' are worth 10 each. Furthermore, \'A\' can either be worth 1 or 11 points depending on the users choice. At the beginning of each round, the player can choose to either ask for 1 more card to increase their total points or they can choose to stay, keeping their hand. The player with the closest total points to 21 or has the sum of 21 with the lowest number of cards wins! Unfortunately, if the player's total does surpass 21, they are \"busted\" (loses the match)"<<endl;

**Game Description: Blackjack**

The goal of the game is to try to get as close as possible to the number 21, inclusively. To do this, each player will be dealt 2 regular cards (2 - A). J, Q, K are all worth 10 while A can be 1 or 11. The rest of the numbers represent its own number. The sum of the points is how much the hand is worth. At the beginning of each round, the player can ask for 1 more card to improve their hand or they can “stay”, keeping their hand. The player closes to 21, or has a sum of 21 with the least amount of cards wins! If the player exceeds 21, then they are “busted” (loses match).

Each player (including 1 opponent) starts with $10,000. Each match’s minimum betting from each player is $1,000. After players receive their initial cards, they can “raise” to bet more money. The other player will have to either match the amount or can “raise” higher. After the other player raises, the 1st player will have to match it and the round commences. Whoever does not want to match loses the round immediately and loses money. Once a round is matched, players can either request a card or reveal or fold (forfeit match). However, if a player cannot pay the minimum or match because they do not have enough money, they must use all their remaining money.

Once one of the players loses all his/her money after a match, they lose. Then, the game ends. The player can choose to restart.
